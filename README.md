Addons for Vanilla Forums 
=======

The `plugins` folder is what this repository is all about. It holds open source addons for [Vanilla Forums](http://vanillaforums.com/) created and maintained by the Vanilla Forums team. They are available for official download in our [searchable directory](http://vanillaforums.org/addons) along with community contributions. 

Individual plugins should have their own license and README. Please start issues by prefixing the issue title with the addon name.
